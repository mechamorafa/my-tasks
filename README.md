# My Tasks

A simple to-do App in JavaScript which uses local storage.

## Features
- Three buckets: **To-do**, **Doing**, **Done**.
- Tasks automatically move to the next bucket when you click the checkbox.
- A delete button is available to remove tasks.
- A counter displays the total number of current tasks both in the HTML body and in the page title.

## How It Works
- **To-do**: New tasks start in this bucket.
- **Doing**: When a task is marked as in progress by clicking the checkbox, it moves here.
- **Done**: Completed tasks are moved to this bucket when the checkbox is clicked again.
- Tasks can be deleted at any stage using the **Delete** button next to each task.
